Monet GAN: Generating Monet-style Artwork

Problem Description:

The goal of this project is to create a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) capable of generating images that mimic the style of Claude Monet’s artwork. GANs consist of two neural networks: the Generator and the Discriminator. These networks function in opposition, with the Generator creating potential images and the Discriminator assessing their authenticity. This adversarial process pushes the Generator to produce images that are increasingly similar to real artwork, ultimately making them indistinguishable from Monet’s style.

Data Description:

The dataset consists of Monet paintings and photographs. The Monet images are used to train the GAN to generate new images that mimic Monet's style. The dataset is available on Kaggle as part of the "I'm Something of a Painter Myself" competition.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):

Generator: Produces synthetic data such as images that initially starts as random noise and gradually improves to look more realistic over time.
Discriminator: Serves as the evaluator, determining whether the data is real or fake, and gets better at identifying fakes as it trains.
GANs work through a dynamic competition between the two networks: one creates, the other critiques, and together they refine the output, leading to impressive results.
